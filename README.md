3rd project of Data Analyst Nanodegree, OpenStreetMap Data Wrangling

In this project, the quality of OpenStreetMap (OSM) XML data is audited and the problematic data is
ironed out programmatically with Python. After the data cleaning, they are converted into .csv files
according to its element tags, and stored in SQL database in order to perform some basic database
queries.

The OSM data chosen for this project is a custom extracted map of City of Perth, Western Australia
from Map Zen.
